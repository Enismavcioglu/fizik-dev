# How To Prepare Mantı
 The first step is to prepare the dough from flour and water. Then cutting dough into small squares pieces. We will fill this pieces with minced meat which we should prepare before by chopping the onions on small pieces, adding black pepper, salt and minced meat all together.

 After putting this mixture we should close the dough and the meat must be covered. We should put mantı into hot water and boil it about fifteen minutes.

 For serving we will put boiled mantı on the plate and add white yoghurt, red pepper and melted butter on it. Now you can enjoy your food.
